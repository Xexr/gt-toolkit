# Beads Creation - EXPANSION VERSION
#
# This is the expansion-type version that can be composed into other workflows.
# Converts a reviewed implementation plan into beads epics/sub-epics/issues
# with validated dependencies for maximum parallelization.
#
# Steps:
#   1. Load inputs (validate plan.md + plan-review.md exist)
#   2. Draft structure (feature epic → phase sub-epics → task issues)
#   3. Review Pass 1: Completeness (sequential — fix before next pass)
#   4. Review Pass 2: Dependencies (sequential — fix before next pass)
#   5. Review Pass 3: Clarity (sequential — fix before next pass)
#   6. User checkpoint (AskUserQuestion with summary)
#   7. Execute (create beads via bd commands)
#   8. Report & commit

EXPANSION: Convert a reviewed implementation plan into beads issues.

This is an expansion-type formula for composition into other workflows.
It transforms a single step into the full plan-to-beads process.

Takes the plan produced by plan-writing (and reviewed by plan-review-to-spec)
and produces a fully-structured beads hierarchy:
- 1 feature epic (top-level)
- Phase sub-epics (one per plan phase)
- Task issues (one per plan task, with acceptance criteria)
- Blocker dependencies (only TRUE blockers — maximize parallelism)

Uses 3 sequential review passes with fixes applied between each,
then a user checkpoint before executing bd commands.

Validate that all required artifacts exist before drafting beads structure.

## Bead Lifecycle Commands

This formula creates beads using `bd` commands. Reference:

```bash
# Create an epic
bd create "Title" -t epic -p <priority> -d "Description"

# Create a task issue
bd create "Title" -t task -p <priority> -d "Description" \
  --acceptance "- [ ] Criterion 1\n- [ ] Criterion 2"

# Add parent-child relationship (epic contains issue)
bd dep add <parent-id> <child-id> --type parent-child

# Add blocker dependency (A must finish before B can start)
bd dep add <blocker-id> <blocked-id>

# Check for dependency cycles
bd dep cycles

# List items ready to work (no unresolved blockers)
bd ready

# Show a bead
bd show <bead-id>

# Close a bead
bd close <bead-id>
```

Do NOT use `bd start`, `bd progress`, or `bd set-state` — these do not exist.

## Required Files

1. **Plan:** `plans/{{feature}}/03-plan/plan.md`
   - If missing: STOP. Report error: "No plan found. Run plan-writing first."

2. **Plan Review:** `plans/{{feature}}/03-plan/plan-review.md`
   - If missing: WARN but continue. The plan hasn't been reviewed, which means
     there may be spec coverage gaps. Note this in the draft.

## Validation

Read the plan and confirm it has the expected structure:
- Phased Delivery section with numbered phases
- Tasks within each phase (numbered X.Y format)
- Acceptance criteria per task
- Spec Coverage Matrix
- Dependencies between tasks

Count:
- Number of phases
- Number of tasks per phase
- Total tasks
- Tasks with explicit dependencies

## Setup

```bash
mkdir -p plans/{{feature}}/04-beads
```

## Output

# STEP 2: DRAFT STRUCTURE
# ============================================================================

[[template]]
id = "{target}.draft-structure"
title = "Draft beads structure"
needs = ["{target}.load-inputs"]
description = """
Create a written draft of the beads hierarchy before any review or execution.

## Read Inputs

Read the full plan:
- `plans/{{feature}}/03-plan/plan.md`
- `plans/{{feature}}/03-plan/plan-review.md` (if it exists — check for any
  unresolved P2s that should inform issue descriptions)

## Mapping Rules

The plan has a specific structure that maps mechanically to beads:

### Hierarchy

```
Feature Epic: "{{feature}}"
├── Sub-Epic: Phase 1 — [Phase Name]
│   ├── Issue: Task 1.1 — [Task Title]
│   ├── Issue: Task 1.2 — [Task Title]
│   └── Issue: Task 1.3 — [Task Title]
├── Sub-Epic: Phase 2 — [Phase Name]
│   ├── Issue: Task 2.1 — [Task Title]
│   └── Issue: Task 2.2 — [Task Title]
└── Sub-Epic: Phase N — [Phase Name]
    └── ...
```

- **1 feature epic** (top-level) — title: `{{feature}}`
- **1 sub-epic per plan phase** — title: `Phase N: [Phase Name]`
- **1 issue per plan task** — title: `[Task Title]` (from the plan's task title)

### Issue Content

For each task issue, extract from the plan:

- **Description:** The "What" field + "Key details" from the plan task.
  Include specific file paths, function signatures, patterns to follow.
  The description must be self-contained — an agent with no prior context
  should be able to implement it from the description alone.

- **Acceptance criteria:** Copy directly from the plan's checkbox items.
  These are already in `- [ ] criterion` format.

- **Priority:** Inherit from the plan phase or default to P2.
  Phase 1 tasks → P1. All other phases → P2.

### Dependencies

Extract dependencies from two sources:

1. **Explicit task dependencies:** The plan's "Dependencies" field on each task
   (e.g., "Task 1.2 must complete first"). These become blocker deps.

2. **Phase ordering:** Tasks in Phase N are blocked by the Phase N-1 exit criteria.
   BUT: only add cross-phase blockers where the plan explicitly states a prerequisite.
   Do NOT assume all of Phase 1 must finish before any Phase 2 task starts —
   only add the specific cross-phase blockers the plan documents.

3. **Within a phase:** Tasks are independent (parallel) unless the plan explicitly
   states a dependency. Do NOT infer sequential ordering from task numbering.

**Dependency principle:** When in doubt, leave it OUT. False blockers kill
parallelism. Missing blockers can be added later; false blockers delay work.

## Coverage Matrix

Create a matrix mapping every plan task to its bead:

```
| Plan Task | Bead Title | Sub-Epic |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| 1.1 [Title] | [Title] | Phase 1: [Name] |
| 1.2 [Title] | [Title] | Phase 1: [Name] |
| 2.1 [Title] | [Title] | Phase 2: [Name] |
...
```

**Every plan task MUST appear.** Missing tasks = work not captured = failure.

Also check the plan's "Shared Abstractions" section — these may need dedicated
issues in Phase 1 if they aren't already covered by numbered tasks.

## Output

Write the complete draft to: `plans/{{feature}}/04-beads/beads-draft.md`

Use this format:
```markdown

## Your Role: Completeness Review

Verify that EVERY actionable item in the plan has a corresponding bead.
You are answering: 'Did the draft miss any work from the plan?'

## Inputs

Read these files:
- `plans/{{feature}}/04-beads/beads-draft.md` — the draft to review
- `plans/{{feature}}/03-plan/plan.md` — the source plan

## Checks

### 1. Task Coverage
Walk through every numbered task in every phase of the plan.
For each task, verify it appears in the draft's coverage matrix AND
has a corresponding issue with matching content.

### 2. Acceptance Criteria Preservation
For each plan task's acceptance criteria checkboxes, verify they
appear verbatim in the corresponding bead issue. Nothing dropped.

### 3. Shared Abstractions
Check the plan's 'Shared Abstractions' section. Each abstraction
should either be a dedicated issue or clearly covered within an
existing issue's description.

### 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns
Check the plan's cross-cutting sections (Error Handling, Testing
Strategy, Migration). Are these captured in relevant issues'
descriptions or acceptance criteria?

### 5. Technical Details
For each plan task's 'Key details' and 'Files' sections, verify
this information appears in the corresponding bead's description.
File paths, function signatures, and patterns must be preserved.

Verify that dependencies are correct, minimal, and maximize parallelism.
You are answering: 'Are the blockers real, and are we missing any?'

## Inputs

Read these files:
- `plans/{{feature}}/04-beads/beads-draft.md` — the draft to review
- `plans/{{feature}}/03-plan/plan.md` — the source plan (for explicit deps)

## Checks

### 1. False Sequential Ordering
For EACH blocker dependency in the draft, answer:
- Does the blocker truly need to COMPLETE before the blocked task can START?
- Or could they run in parallel with the blocked task consuming the result later?
- Would removing this blocker create any actual problem?

Flag any dependency where the answer is 'could run in parallel'.

### 2. Missing Blockers
For each task, consider:
- Does it reference types/interfaces created by another task?
- Does it modify a file that another task also modifies (merge conflict risk)?
- Does the plan explicitly state a prerequisite that isn't captured?

### 3. Cross-Phase Dependencies
Check that cross-phase blockers match what the plan states.
Do NOT add blanket 'all of Phase N blocks all of Phase N+1' deps.
Only specific task-to-task blockers that the plan documents.

### 4. Circular Dependencies
Check for any circular chains: A blocks B blocks C blocks A.
These would prevent `bd dep cycles` from passing.

### 5. Parallelism Assessment
Count:
- How many tasks are ready immediately (no blockers)?
- What's the longest dependency chain (critical path)?
- Could any changes increase parallelism without creating risk?

## Output

Return your findings as a structured report:

**Missing blockers (add):** K
**Circular chains:** [none / list]

### False Blockers (Remove)

### Missing Blockers (Add)

- Can each criterion be objectively verified (not 'works correctly')?
- Are there test-related criteria where appropriate?
- Do criteria cover edge cases mentioned in the plan?

- Does the description assume knowledge from other issues?
- Are there references like 'as described above' or 'see Phase 1'

Execute bd commands to create the full beads hierarchy.

## Execution Order

**Order matters.** Create parents before children, then add dependencies.

### 1. Create Feature Epic

```bash
bd create "{{feature}}" -t epic -p P1 -d "[Description from draft]"
```

Capture the returned bead ID — all sub-epics will reference it.

### 2. Create Phase Sub-Epics

For each phase in order:
```bash
bd create "Phase N: [Phase Name]" -t epic -p [P1/P2] \
  -d "[Phase objective from draft]"
bd dep add <feature-epic-id> <phase-sub-epic-id> --type parent-child
```

Capture each sub-epic's bead ID — issues will reference them.

### 3. Create Task Issues

For each task issue in order:
```bash
bd create "[Task Title]" -t task -p [P1/P2] \
  -d "[Full description from draft]" \
  --acceptance "[Acceptance criteria from draft]"
bd dep add <phase-sub-epic-id> <task-issue-id> --type parent-child
```

Capture each issue's bead ID — dependencies will reference them.

**Important:** The acceptance criteria string uses `\n` for newlines between
criteria items. Example:
```bash
--acceptance "- [ ] Criterion 1\n- [ ] Criterion 2\n- [ ] Criterion 3"
```

### 4. Add Blocker Dependencies

For each blocker dependency from the draft's Dependencies table:
```bash
bd dep add <blocker-bead-id> <blocked-bead-id>
```

### 5. Verify

```bash
bd dep cycles    # Must return empty — no circular dependencies
bd ready         # Should show expected number of unblocked items
```

If `bd dep cycles` finds cycles, fix them by removing the dependency that
creates the cycle (refer to the draft's Dependencies table for which one
is least critical).

## ID Tracking

Maintain a mapping as you create beads:

```
Plan Reference → Bead ID
─────────────────────────
Feature epic   → gt-XXXX
Phase 1        → gt-YYYY
Task 1.1       → gt-ZZZZ
Task 1.2       → gt-AAAA
...
```

This mapping is needed for:
- Adding parent-child relationships
- Adding blocker dependencies
- The final report

## Error Handling

If a `bd create` command fails:
- Report the error
- Do NOT retry blindly — check the error message
- Common issues: duplicate titles, invalid priority format
- If stuck, report what was created so far and stop
