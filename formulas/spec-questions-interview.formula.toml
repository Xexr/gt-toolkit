Review a spec for gaps and ambiguities through focused clarifying questions.

Two-pass approach:
1. Completeness check - verify prior scope questions were addressed (based on user's selected scope)
2. Fresh assessment - identify NEW gaps with fresh eyes (not limited to original questions)

This is part of the design-to-implementation pipeline.

## Step Lifecycle (Molecule Work Loop)

This formula runs as a molecule — each step is a wisp bead. Use the
standard molecule work loop to advance through steps:

```bash
# 1. Find your current step:
bd mol current <molecule-id>

# 2. Execute the step (follow its instructions)

# 3. Close the step when done:
bd close <step-id>

# 4. Find the next step:
bd mol current <molecule-id>

# 5. Repeat until molecule complete
```

`bd mol current` returns the next ready step (open + all blocking deps
closed). Closing a step unblocks the next one in the dependency chain.

**Crash recovery:** Each `bd close` is durable. If your session crashes,
the next session runs `gt prime` which detects the molecule on your hook
and shows progress. `bd mol current` picks up at the next unclosed step.

Do NOT batch-close all steps at the end — close each one as you finish it.
