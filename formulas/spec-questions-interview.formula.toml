Review a spec for gaps and ambiguities through focused clarifying questions.

Two-pass approach:
1. Completeness check - verify prior scope questions were addressed (based on user's selected scope)
2. Fresh assessment - identify NEW gaps with fresh eyes (not limited to original questions)

This is part of the design-to-implementation pipeline.
