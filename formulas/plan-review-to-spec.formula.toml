# Plan Review to Spec Formula
#
# Verify the implementation plan fully addresses the spec and aligns with
# the codebase analysis. Uses 3 parallel review agents checking bidirectional
# coverage (spec→plan, plan→spec) plus codebase consistency (plan→context).
#
# Requires:
#   - plans/<feature>/02-spec/spec.md (output of spec-workflow)
#   - plans/<feature>/03-plan/plan.md (output of plan-writing)
#   - plans/<feature>/03-plan/plan-context.md (optional, from plan-writing)
#
# Usage:
#   gt sling plan-review-to-spec <crew> \
#     --var feature="task-templates"

description = """
Verify the implementation plan fully addresses the spec.

Runs 3 parallel review agents:
1. Spec→Plan (forward): Does every spec requirement have plan coverage?
2. Plan→Spec (reverse): Does every plan item trace back to a spec basis?
3. Plan→Context: Is the plan consistent with the codebase analysis?

Presents findings interactively, resolves issues, and commits updates.

Requires: plans/<feature>/02-spec/spec.md and plans/<feature>/03-plan/plan.md
Output: plans/<feature>/03-plan/plan-review.md

## Step Lifecycle (Molecule Work Loop)

This formula runs as a molecule — each step is a wisp bead. Use the
standard molecule work loop to advance through steps:

```bash
# 1. Find your current step:
bd mol current <molecule-id>

# 2. Execute the step (follow its instructions)

# 3. Close the step when done:
bd close <step-id>

# 4. Find the next step:
bd mol current <molecule-id>

# 5. Repeat until molecule complete
```

`bd mol current` returns the next ready step (open + all blocking deps
closed). Closing a step unblocks the next one in the dependency chain.

**Crash recovery:** Each `bd close` is durable. If your session crashes,
the next session runs `gt prime` which detects the molecule on your hook
and shows progress. `bd mol current` picks up at the next unclosed step.

Do NOT batch-close all steps at the end — close each one as you finish it.
