# Multimodal Design Scope Questions (3x3 Matrix)
#
# Each model (Opus, GPT, Gemini) explores ALL THREE perspectives:
# - User Advocate: What do users expect?
# - Product Designer: What's the UX flow?
# - Domain Expert: What's missing from the problem domain?
#
# Result: 9 analyses -> 3 model documents -> 1 synthesized question backlog
#
# Usage:

description = """
Surface design blind spots using a 3x3 matrix of models and perspectives.

Each model (Opus, GPT, Gemini) independently explores three perspectives:
- User Advocate: What would users expect? What's confusing?
- Product Designer: What's the UX flow? What interactions are implied?
- Domain Expert: What domain concepts are missing? What do similar products do?

This gives 9 individual analyses, consolidated into 3 model-specific documents,
then synthesized into a final prioritized question backlog.

This is a DESIGN pass focused on USER INTENT, not implementation.
